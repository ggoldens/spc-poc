# WebRTC Single Peer Connection POC

The purpose of this app is to play with single peer connections.
The idea is to have one single peer connection for publishing and subscribing all the media streams.


In order to test this app:

* Run `npm install`

* Run `npm start`

* Open the app in one tab in http://localhost:3000

* Click on Start.

* Open the app in a second tab in http://localhost:3000

* Click on Start.

* Add as many publishers as you want in the first tab.
